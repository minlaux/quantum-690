# Simulating a Quantum Network with Satellite Repeaters

## Plan
- Create code class
- Set variables for distances

### Variables
- LEO: < 2000km (where satellite should be); lowest satellite altitude is 167,4km
- Num repeaters: 1-3 (?)
- Distance between A and B: > 2000km (hard max for establishing quantum link)
- China's satellite distance between repeater and ground station: 1200km

### Considerations
- Distance A to R and R to B: equidistent? would make sense to have the strongest link between all ground stations and satellite
- Noise: weather
